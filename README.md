To build a password strength assessment tool, we can write a Python script that checks the strength of a given password based on the following criteria:

Length: The password should be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
Numbers: The password should contain at least one numeric character.
Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).
We can assign different weightings to each of these criteria and generate a score to determine the strength of the password.
